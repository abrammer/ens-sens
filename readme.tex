{\Large\bf NHC Ensemble-based Sensitivity Code Readme}
\flushleft
\vspace{0.3in}

This document provides a description of the enclosed code, that can be used to compute ensemble-based
sensitivity from gridded ensemble forecast data.  The enclosed set of code is written in conda python
and is designed to work with any grib files that contain forecast data on a lat/lon grid.  Most of the
settings for this program are set within a configuration/parameter file, while the date, storm, and
parameter file itself are set at the command line.  Furthermore,
the code is designed to work for a variety of models and computing locations.  Those differences related
to various locations and models is also isolated to the individual i/o module, which has common routine
names, but does all of the model/location specific differences inside of it and is transparent to 
the rest of the code.

The code itself consists of four distinct stages, all of which are controled by run\_NHC\_sens.py

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data staging and preparation (model and platform specific)
\item Computing forecast metrics (fcst\_metrics\_tc.py)
\item Compute forecast fields to compute sensitivity to (compute\_tc\_fields.py)
\item Compute sensitivity and generate maps (nhc\_sens.py)
\end{enumerate}

In order to generate sensitivity output, the user should run the following code from the unix 
command line, which is the command for the Hurricane Laura forecast initialized 0000~UTC 22 August 2020:

\vspace{0.1in}
python run\_NHC\_sens.py --init 2020082200 --storm laura13l --param ecmwf\_teton.py, 
\vspace{0.1in}

where the --init argument is the forecast initialization date in yyyymmddhh format, --storm is the 
TC name, including both the name, TC number, and the basin.  The TC number and basin are necessary 
as the code parses the storm text string to figure out the basin and TC number.  Finally, --param is
the path to the paramter/configuration file, that contains a number of configuration options that are
meant to be static from one initialization time/storm to another, but still gives the user the option
to change how the code executes, or how the plots look.  Most of the configuration options have 
default values, though some MUST be set within the file for the code to work.  The tables below list 
the individual parameter/configuration options available and the default values, where appropriate.

The outcome of running this code is a set of output directories that include the graphical and 
gridded sensitivity output.  The format of these directory is:

\vspace{0.1in}
\{html\_dir\}/\{storm\}\_\{yyyymmddhh\}/\{metric\}/sens/\{field\},
\vspace{0.1in}

where storm is the name of the TC (same as --storm line above), yyyymmddhh is the initialization date
(same as --init line above), metric is the name of each forecast metric, where each forecast metric has its own
directory.  For example, the integrated track metric (the default metric of the code) is named 
f120\_intmajtrack.  Positive values of the metric are indicative of a TC that will end up further along and/or i
to the right of the ensemble-mean track.  The advantage of using this position metric is that it does not 
require specifying a particular lead time and takes into account the temporal correlation of forecast tracks 
(i.e., members that are further west early in the forecast will end up further west later on).  The user
can specify additional metrics to compute sensitivity for using the metrics configuration option.

Within each forecast metric directory are two sub-directories, one is called sens,
which are the sensitivity plots/grids on a fixed domain, while the other are the plots/grids on a storm-centered
grid.  Within each of these directories is a set of subdirectories that represent individual
forecast fields that you are computing the sensitivity to.  The forecast hour in each file's name is the
forecast lead time that you are computing the sensitivity to (i.e., a file starting with 202008200\_f036 is 
the sensitivity of the metric to the 36~h forecast fields.).  The table below gives the list of fields
for which the sensitivity of TC track/position forecasts are computed and what they represent:

\begin{tabular}{|p{1.25in}|p{5.0in}|}
\hline
Parameter Name & Description \\  \hline\hline
usteer & Zonal component of the steering flow.  By default, this is designated as the average wind between
300-850~hPa (vortex removed), but this can be changed in the configuration file. \\ \hline
vsteer & Meridional component of the steering flow.  By default, this is designated as the average wind between
300-850~hPa (vortex removed), but this can be changed in the configuration file. \\ \hline
masteer & Major axis winds are the wind component that is in the direction of greatest track variability for 
that particular case (positive values are either along and/or right of track).  In most situations, the 
sensitivity to the major axis wind is the most useful for sensitivity calculations because it most closely 
relates to variability in subsequent TC position, which is not often in the Cartesian directions.  \\ \hline
